        <h2>Personal Reflections & Contemporary Relevance</h2>
        <p>
          Prof. Sinha's analysis remains strikingly relevant in 2024. Despite
          the Right to Education Act (2009) and increased enrollment figures,
          educational quality and equity remain contested. Her critique exposes
          a fundamental paradox: schools exist, but they often fail children
          living in poverty.
        </p>

        <p style={{ marginTop: "1.5rem" }}>
          <strong>For educators:</strong> This work demands introspection. How
          do our teaching practices reflect or challenge systemic inequities? Do
          we recognize poverty as a structural barrier, not a personal failing?
          Can we mobilize our classrooms as spaces of critical consciousness,
          where marginalized voices are centered and validated?
        </p>

        <p style={{ marginTop: "1.5rem" }}>
          <strong>For policymakers:</strong> "Battle for Schools" insists that
          compliance with enrollment targets is insufficient. Quality, safety,
          and genuine learning must be measured. Community accountability
          mechanisms—not just top-down inspections—are essential. Budget
          allocation must prioritize the poorest schools, not reinforce existing
          hierarchies.
        </p>

        <p style={{ marginTop: "1.5rem" }}>
          <strong>For society:</strong> This work reframes education as an
          instrument of social justice, not social reproduction. If we truly
          believe in democracy and equality, educational entitlement cannot be
          negotiable. Prof. Sinha's "battle" calls us to examine complicity—how
          we benefit from educational exclusion—and to organize for systemic
          change.
        </p>

        <p style={{ marginTop: "1.5rem" }}>
          The most powerful lesson from this work is that change is possible.
          Communities have proven that when they organize, demand
          accountability, and claim their rights, schools transform. The battle
          continues, but so does the hope.
