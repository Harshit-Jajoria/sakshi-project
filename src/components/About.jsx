        <p>
          In "Battle for Schools: Struggle of the Poor for Their Entitlement to
          Education," Prof. Shantha Sinha presents a seminal analysis of
          educational inequity in India. This portfolio synthesizes her
          groundbreaking research, examining the systemic barriers that prevent
          vulnerable communities—particularly children in rural and economically
          disadvantaged regions—from accessing their constitutional right to
          quality education.

          Through empirical evidence, personal narratives, and policy
          frameworks, Prof. Sinha argues that educational access is not merely
          an individual achievement but a social entitlement. This work
          challenges prevailing notions of meritocracy and offers actionable
          solutions for creating genuinely inclusive schooling systems that
          serve the poor with dignity and rigor.
