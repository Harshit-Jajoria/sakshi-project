        <h2>Structural Barriers to Educational Access</h2>
        <p>
          Prof. Sinha identifies multidimensional barriers that prevent children
          in poverty from accessing quality education. These challenges extend
          far beyond individual circumstances— they are embedded in governance
          structures, social hierarchies, and economic systems.

        <ul style={{ marginTop: "2rem" }}>
          <li>
            <strong>Poverty & Economic Exclusion</strong> – Families prioritize
            immediate survival; school fees, uniforms, and opportunity costs
            create insurmountable barriers
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Social Exclusion & Discrimination</strong> – Caste-based
            stigma, gender biases, and religious discrimination prevent
            equitable classroom participation
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Infrastructure Deficits</strong> – No schools in walking
            distance, absent sanitation facilities, and lack of teaching
            materials compound exclusion
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Institutional Apathy & Corruption</strong> – Bureaucratic
            indifference, teacher absenteeism, and misappropriation of education
            funds drain resources
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Privatization & Commercialization</strong> – Profit-driven
            schooling deepens inequity; the poorest are left in underfunded
            government institutions
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Gender-Based Violence & Child Protection</strong> – Girls
            face additional threats; unsafe schools and harassment deter
            attendance and persistence
          </li>
        </ul>
