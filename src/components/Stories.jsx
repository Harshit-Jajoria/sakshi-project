        <h2>Stories of Struggle </h2>
        <p>
          Empirical research and lived experiences reveal the human faces behind
          educational inequality. These narratives ground abstract policy in
          concrete reality—transforming how we understand the fight for
          equitable schooling.

          These stories illustrate the profound impact of Prof. Sinha's work.
          When communities are mobilized to monitor schools and demand
          accountability, transformations occur. Schools become safer. Teachers
          become more dedicated. Learning outcomes improve. Most importantly,
          children—especially girls and marginalized children—see themselves as
          agents of change rather than passive recipients.

        <p style={{ marginTop: "1.5rem" }}>
          Communities that once watched their children struggle in
          poverty-stricken schools have organized, advocated, and secured
          government resources. Villages that had no schools for decades now
          have functioning learning centers. The "battle" is not a distant
          struggle—it unfolds in homes, fields, and classrooms every day.
